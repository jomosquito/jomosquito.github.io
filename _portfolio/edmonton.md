title: "Edmonton"
excerpt: "Edmonton is a university forms management system that allows students to submit various administrative requests and enables staff to process them through defined approval workflows. The system handles several types of forms:

Medical/Administrative Term Withdrawal requests
Student-Initiated Course Drop requests
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) Release forms
Name/SSN Change requests

Key features include:

User authentication with Microsoft OAuth integration
Role-based access control (student, department chair, president, admin)
Role delegation capability for administrators
PDF generation for completed forms using LaTeX
Workflow configuration for form approvals
Digital signature support
Docker containerization for deployment

The application is structured following typical Flask patterns with routes, templates, and database models using SQLAlchemy. It appears to be designed for a university environment to streamline administrative processes and form submissions.<br/>"
